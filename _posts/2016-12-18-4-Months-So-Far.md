It has been four months since I came here. The blog has suspended for nearly 2 months. Yesterday finished finals, make some updates.

Just made Tofu soup with sauce bought from H-Mart. I used to believe Kaju Tofu Soup is the best Korea Tofu Soup in Boston, but now I see, with good sauce we can also make it by myself, and is really really cheap!

Spend lots of money on eat in the four months. I recognized myself don't take so much care on food before, but after months of months shity food cooked by myself, totally gave in. Then after 2 months eating outside, also get tired.

Every time I spent another bill on eating, I said to myself, "well, I will make the money back"... But it seems a mock now. Not successful in the last job hunting, spend so much time and efforts, but still no good result. Too much darkness, where is the light T_T.
