I used to store my blogs at [cnblog][1], but now I will start move the old blogs here and translate them all in English. It will be a long task so I am not sure when it's finished. Anyway I will try my best.

Thanks to [Lirian Su][2], an awesome geek and nice guy, We worked together in developing a Version Control System at QAD Inc. and he taught me to use Git and Jekyll to publish and store my blogs.

Mostly I will publish articles about programming techinques and summaries. Sometimes I will publish some personal things like travel and feelings.

In one word, anything is for fun~.
