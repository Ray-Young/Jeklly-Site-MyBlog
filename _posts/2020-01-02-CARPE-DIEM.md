<i>
'CARPE DIEM' is a short pharse in LatÄ«na, meaning seize the day. I first
learned from ``The Dead Poets Society``, a movie directed by Peter Weir.

<i>
In memory of Robin Williams, the figure which he built in Dead Poets Society will live forever.

Because we are food for worms

Because believe it or not, each and every one of us is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold and die

Same haircuts, full of hormones, just like you

![image2][2]

Invincible, just like you feel

The world is their oyster

They believe they are destined for great things

Just like many of you

Their eyes are full of hope, just like you

Did they wait until it was too late to make from their life even one iota of what they were capable?

Because you see, gentleman,

These boys are now fertilizing daffodils
