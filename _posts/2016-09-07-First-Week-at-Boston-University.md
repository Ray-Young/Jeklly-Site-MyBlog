### First Night
Arrived at Boston at 31 August, it's already very late after checking in the hotel and go to the market for the furniture. It's bit rainy at night.

When I first got to my aunt's house, I only took 2 luggage with me. But when I came to Boston, I took 4 luggage with me... I don't know what I have bought in 
these two weeks...

### Check in Dorm
In September 1st, I came to the dorm. The outside scenery is pretty good.

But when you came inside the dorm... That's really a mess. A strong smell of 
formaldehyde... Really put me in a crazy situation.

Forget it. Let's see a good scenery of Boston.

### Railway
It's a night railway picture of Boston. The traffic of Boston is similiar to 
Beijing. Both Boston and Beijing has a long history, which makes it's hard to build modern traffic due to the ancient buildings.

### Setup
Setup a room just like setup a development environment. The most difficult part in programming is not write a complex algorithm, but seting up the development environment. So as assemble the furniture and clean up the room. Let's see the result of my work.

### Awesome Amazon
I bought the bed, mattress and chair from Amazon. While on August 31, it said the bed was lost. On Sep 1st, it said the mattress was lost. On Sep 2nd, it said the char was lost. Hooooooooooooooooooooooooooly shit, Fuck UPS. Amazon promise to resend these items to me, but I still slept on the floor for two days. 

The best part is, On 5th Sep, all these items arrived... Fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk UPS again. So after all, I have to send back all these items to Amazon...
