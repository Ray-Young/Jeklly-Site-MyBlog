### Introduction
K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-Means are a pair of classification
and clustering algorithm. They are both essential algorithms in Data
Mining. Furthermore, a gate to Machine learning, Data Science and
deep learning fields.

### K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
In general, KNN is a classification algorithm. Given that we know
several groups, when it comes a new candidate, KNN gives one way to
calculate which group it belongs to.
