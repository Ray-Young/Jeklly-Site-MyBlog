Hi, I am Raymond Yang (Chinese: 杨磊). Currently I live in Boston and I am a master student of Computer Science at [Boston University][4]. 

Before the master degree, I had 11 months (2015 - 2016) full-time SDE experience in [QAD Inc][12] at Foundation Framework Team, Shanghai, China. Besides, a 3-month (2014) QA & Developer internship experience in [SAP][13] at Social Network Software Team, Shanghai, China.

I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Software Engineering from [Tongji University][5] at 2015, Shanghai, China.

<h4> Professional </h4>
As a Java programmer, I have used Java for over 4 years in developing Java and Android applications. I love developing useful applications to help people solve real problems.
 My [github] [6] shows the results of my personal works. A [Short List][10] for my primary achievements in programming.

<h4> Before this blog </h4>
I used to store all my posts at [cnblog][2], however, they were all written in Chinese. Now I will start moving the old posts to here and translate them into English.

<h4> This blog </h4>

I will record technical problems I have met and how to solve these problems
in the blog. Also, I will write exciting things and awesome moments that
I have been through. Wish this blog can help you and bring fun to your life~

Thanks to [Lirian Su][3] introduce Jekyll and Github page to me!
