My name is Lei Yang. You can call me Raymond, Or just Ray is ok

I was born and grown in Shanghai and graduated from Tongji University.

I used to work at SAP and QAD as a Software Engineer. In the work I mostly use Perl, Java and Ruby.

Besides, I am interested in Android and Objective-C. Being an APP developer is always on my list.

I used to store my blogs at [cnblog][2], but now I will start moving the old blogs here and translate them all in English. There are many works to do and I am not sure when it will  be finished. Anyway I will try my best.

Thanks to [Lirian Su][3], an awesome geek and nice guy, We worked together in developing a Version Control System at QAD Inc. and he taught me to use Git and Jekyll to publish and store my blogs.

Now I am a graduate candidate in Boston University, majoring in Computer Science.

Love travel, love sports, love moives, love all fantastic things and awesome people.

Someone Once said 

'In this world there are 2% what you know, 2% what you know that you don't know, and 96% what you don't know that you don't know.'

Love exploring the unknown, exploring all eautiful and mysterious things in the world.
